<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>This guide will help you get set up and ready to stream. Depending on what you want to stream, the steps may change slightly but we aim to cover as much as possible while keeping it as simple as possible.</p>
<h2 id="quick-guide">Quick Guide</h2>
<p>You will need the following to get out there to the world:</p>
<ol>
<li>Either an Apple Macbook Pro / iMac / Mac Mini or Windows based desktop or laptop.</li>
<li>A microphone</li>
<li>A webcam</li>
<li>An internet connection</li>
<li>Streaming Software</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="pc-hardware">1. PC Hardware</h1>
<h4 id="q.-which-is-better-apple-or-windows">Q. Which is better? Apple or Windows?</h4>
<p>Honestly, from a streaming perspective, I cannot recommend going with Windows strongly enough. From a software perspective, there are numerous free tools on Windows which are amazing and have no issues. On a Mac however, most of the free tools are incomplete so we need to use an expensive application or workarounds to get most things working correctly.</p>
<p>Having said that, here are a list of recommended Apple or Windows PCs / Laptops.</p>
<h2 id="apple">Apple</h2>
<h3 id="imac--imac-pro">iMac / iMac Pro</h3>
<p>Any mid-tier iMac / iMac Pro that features a quad-core CPU, 8GB of ram (minimum) and dedicated graphics card will be sufficient. You can try with older / weaker hardware but I cant guarantee anything.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>21.5 Inch iMac (2017-2019):</strong><br>
<a href="https://apple.co/3dqeIeL">https://apple.co/3dqeIeL</a></p>

</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="macbook-pro">Macbook Pro</h3>
<p>For the smaller Macbook Pro (13 inch), although it is possible to stream on earlier models, you might have problems with large amounts of delay, or errors in the stream. For a smoother show I would recommend the following hardware:**</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>13 Inch Macbook Pro: (2019-onwards)</strong><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> This is the only one with a high-speed CPU, all others are too low-spec for me to recommend, even in 2020).<br>
<a href="https://apple.co/2QDf2wK">https://apple.co/2QDf2wK</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>15 Inch Macbook Pro: (2016-2019)</strong><br>
Note:  Any MBP with the USB-C ports should work fine!<br>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<h3 id="specifications"><strong>Specifications:</strong></h3>
<p>As Windows based PC’s have such a range of different hardware inside, I’ve decided to list a minimum and recommended general specification in addition to some example PC’s or Laptops that I feel will do the job fine.</p>
<h3 id="cpu"><strong>CPU:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Minimum Desktop:</strong><br>
Intel i5 4670 (3.4ghz Quad Core CPU) / AMD R3 3200G</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Desktop:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Minimum Laptop:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommended Laptop:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some of these CPUs are more than 7 years old now but should be able to put on basic shows. If you happen to have a newer CPU, you’ll be able to put on a much smoother and more complex show.</p>
<h3 id="memory"><strong>Memory:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong><br>
8GB of memory (DDR3 or DDR4)</p>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong><br>
16GB (DDR3 / DDR4)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> 8GB of memory will be enough if all you’re doing is streaming. If you’re doing other things on the laptop at the same time we recommend getting at least 16GB of memory.</p>
<h3 id="graphics-card">Graphics Card:</h3>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong><br>
Nvidia GTX 1660</p>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong><br>
Nvidia RTX 2660</p>
<h3 id="operating-system">Operating System:</h3>
<p>Windows 10 64bit</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is available for Windows 7 64bit or Windows 8 64bit but as support is ending soon, I’d recommend using Windows 10.</p>

<h1 id="streaming-hardware">2. Streaming Hardware</h1>
<p>Now we will cover the actual hardware you need to stream, including webcams, microphones, capture devices etc.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to get too technical, I’ve made an Amazon list of parts I would recommend that should get you up and running.</p>
<h2 id="streaming-bundles">Streaming Bundles</h2>
<h3 id="macbook-pro-1"><strong>Macbook Pro:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Fitness</strong></p>
<p><strong>DJ / Games</strong></p>
<p>I’ve broken down each section into three sections. Getting into the professional world of streaming is a bit outside of the scope of this guide, so I will purely cover prosumer / consumer level items. Broken down into <strong>[best]</strong>, <strong>[recommended]</strong> and <strong>[minimal]</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ll also comment on what situation they might be best for.</p>
<h2 id="microphones">Microphones</h2>
<p>I have attempted to compile a list of different ways to get voice into your stream. The best way with most control would be to use a USB sound card that connects up to your Mac or Windows PC and allows you to control the volumes directly from the mixer. If you have no experience with mixers, we would recommend going with something simple such as the minimal or recommended options.</p>

<h2 id="webcams">Webcams</h2>
<p>This section aims to provide a good list of different setups you can use for a webcam. Absolutely the best quality will be a DSLR Camera. Sadly, not all cameras are made equal and there are issues with using them for this purpose. For that reason I have listed my favourite here. I will include a more detailed list of other compatible cameras in a later section.</p>

<li>Magewell USB 3.0 HDMI Full HD<br>

<strong>Note:</strong> Doesn’t need drivers for Mac or Windows and works out of the box. More expensive than Elgato though, but definitely more on the professional side. More prosumer level.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Minimal</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Elgato Camlink<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/39cs22T">Amazon UK Elgato Camlink</a><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> I would also recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/2JaCSvW">Elgato S60+</a> but it doesn’t work with Mac OS out of the box. They provide a piece of software that links the software with the hardware but it’s a little more work. If possible get the Camlink but if they’re unavailable I’ll also explain how to setup the Elgato S60 / S60+ working on a Mac.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="soundcards">Soundcards</h2>
<p>You don’t necessarily need a sound card as all Mac’s and PC’s have sound cards inbuilt, but especially for Macintosh devices, you will find the way they handle audio input to be frustrating. For that reason we would recommend an external sound card.</p>
<p><strong>Best:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Yamaha MG10 Stereo Sound Card &amp; Mixer<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/2J870b5">Amazon UK Yamaha MG10</a><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> This is great because it has a mixer and a sound card inbuilt. This means that if you plug it into a Mac you can bypass the need for weird adaptors to get microphones working, and you’ll have more inputs, and because it has a mixer too we can control more about the sound we bring into the PC from the device rather than using software to do it. This also features multiple XLR inputs for microphones, turntables and more.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 3rd Gen<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3brs0Wx">Amazon UK Focusrite Scarlett 2i2</a><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> This device will allow you to plug in two inputs. For example, a microphone and a turntable and control the volume directly from the device. The benefit of going for one of these is they take XLR input which is commonly used in professional microphones, such as the <strong>“Rode Procaster”</strong> microphone mentioned above.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Minimal</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Plugable USB Audio Adaptor<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/2JdkLFC">Amazon UK Plugable USB Audio Adaptor</a><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Useful for simple jobs and you want to bypass the Apple Macbook 3.5mm audio interface problems. Using this will simplify your streaming life, its plug &amp; play meaning you dont need any special drivers or software for your PC. It should just work when plugged in. Doesn’t include any fancy ports but if you have a standard consumer microphone you would like to use, this will make that work.</li>

<h1 id="software">3. Software</h1>
<h2 id="streaming-software">Streaming Software</h2>
<p>You’ll need to use this software to broadcast to the internet! I’ve listed several different options.</p>
<p><strong>OBS Studio - Recommended</strong><br>
<strong>Description:</strong> The main program your average streamer will use to broadcast to the world. It has a good feature-list that makes it perfect for most streaming situations.<br>
Compatibility: Windows &amp; Mac OS<br>
<strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Official Website</a><br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Streamlabs OBS</strong><br>
<strong>Description:</strong> This was originally based on OBS Studio a long time ago, but since then has changed dramatically (although it’s kept the name). It has extra features that OBS Studio doesn’t have, but with that comes extra bugs and worse performance. Add to that the fact it’s Windows only, and I feel the easiest software to recommend would be OBS Studio.<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows<br>
<strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">Streamlabs Official Website</a><br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Xsplit</strong><br>
<strong>Description:</strong> A paid client to stream online. It has a few extra features such as the ability to stream to Skype and other clients, and performance is better than OBS but not so much that the extra cost is worth it. Also only available on Windows.<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows<br>
<strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.xsplit.com/">Xsplit Official Website</a><br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> £50 / year</p>
<p><strong>Wirecast</strong><br>
<strong>Description:</strong> Wirecast is absolutely the best professional streaming software you can use that includes compatibility with Windows and Mac OS. It’s significantly easier to use than OBS as all the features are integrated and not separate like OBS (OBS is community run and open source).<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows &amp; Mac OS<br>
<strong>Link:</strong><a href="https://www.telestream.net/wirecast/">Wirecast Official Website</a><br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> £550</p>
<p><strong>vMix</strong><br>
Description: vMix is a good middle ground between Wirecast and a free piece of software like OBS, however the free versions of the software offer nowhere near the level of features as OBS, yet the paid versions offer more features and are easier to use. Considering that it’s only compatible for Windows, for the purposes of this guide I wouldn’t recommend them.<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows<br>
<strong>Link:</strong><a href="https://www.vmix.com/">vMix Official Website</a><br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> (Free -  £1000)</p>
<h2 id="additional-software">Additional Software</h2>
<p>Here is a list of additional software that you might need depending on what you want to do or what hardware you’re using.</p>
<p><strong>NDI OBS Plugin</strong><br>
Description: NDI is a piece of software that allows us to send video from certain devices to other devices. The most common use for streaming is an App on the iPhone that can send iPhone camera data to our PC. This will allow us to use the iPhone as a webcam!<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows &amp; Mac OS<br>
<strong>Link:</strong><a href="https://bit.ly/2JaMvuz">NDI OBS Plugin (Github Homepage)</a><br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>NDI Camera App</strong><br>
Description: Using this app, you can send camera data from your phone to a PC or Macbook.<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> iPhone<br>
<strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://apple.co/2vKncfy">NDI Camera App</a><br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> £19.99</p>
<p><strong>Loopback</strong><br>
Description: This app is specifically for Mac OS. If we use this we can send audio from any application on your device to any other application. For example, you can send Spotify audio or Skype audio to OBS.<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> Mac OS<br>
<strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://bit.ly/2UfUFrK">Loopback Website</a><br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> $119</p>
<p><strong>VoiceMeeter Banana</strong><br>
Description: This software does the same thing as Loopback, but it has the advantage of being free. It is slightly harder to use and sadly it is only available for Windows.<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows<br>
<strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://bit.ly/3agCPul">VoiceMeeter Banana Website</a><br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Elgato Camlink Software</strong><br>
Description: You will need this software to run the camlink hardware on your PC or Macbook.<br>

<strong>Cost:</strong> Free</p>
